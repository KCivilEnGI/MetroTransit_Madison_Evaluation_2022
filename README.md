# Metro Transit Redesign Evaluation
Course: Advanced Geocomputing | UW-Madison<br>
Instructor: Song Gao<br><br>

This project evaluates proposed routes for the Metro Transit Redesign using Python for geocomputing techniques and data analysis. Using Folium for mapping and geospatial packages such as Pandas and Geopandas, it analyzes the existing bus stop performance in Madison. In addition, OSMnx and NetworkX were used to calculate the shortest path and mark important areas using Matplotlib and Shapely.<br>
Please note that this evaluation was performed in May 2022. It has had great adjustment since then.
