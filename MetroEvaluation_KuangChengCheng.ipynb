    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, I am going to evaluate the current situation of the Madison metro transit ridership to see if it is reasonable to redesign the whole metro transit network. Also, going through the new proposed metro transit network including the new BRT system with the current bus stop ridership data to find out if the new BRT route would be a reasonable route for the community to have a more frequent and direct bus service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are lots of residents, students, and school faculties who are giving feedback to say that the new proposed routes will make them inconvenient to the bus stops. The issue includes problems with the parking area and the west service desert if they implement the new proposed routes. I would also review if these issues would be geographically true."

    "# Methods\n",
    "### Visualization and Data Analysis \n",
    "#### (1) Folium (interactive map)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the data contains lots of information about the bus stops. Also, the extent of the metro transit covers the whole of Madison, which would be hard for the audience to see the detail. Therefore, I choose Folium to make an interactive map. Using an interactive map can allow everyone who is seeing this notebook to zoom in on where they are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) pandas and GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "These two packages would not only allow me to do statistical analysis but use to convert data into geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) OSMnx and NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "For checking and comparing the BRT routes with the shortest path, these two packages would allow me to download the road network of Madison and combine the data layers I want to make a new map for my audience to easily recognize the routes in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) Matplotlib and Shapely\n",
    "\n",
    "For some parts that don't exist in the data source or the part that I want to highlight, I can use Shapely to create Polygons, Points, and Polylines."

We can see there are lots of parking lots in parks inside and near the red area, so we can know that the comment from attendees is reasonable.

    "\n",
    "In this project, we can learn that redesigning the metro transit system is reasonable because the percentage of effective bus stops is low. We can also learn that some of the bus stops may be important on the weekdays even though they are only effective on weekdays. Thus, some of those areas may need to be treated as different cases. For example, some of the bus routes may only be available on weekdays. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the new BRT design, we have confirmed that the BRT route is designed based on the ridership for serving as many people as possible instead of just a very direct route into downtown Madison. Thus, the proposed BRT route looks reasonable as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the proposed network issue on the westside of Madison, near Middleton, we can see that a new route that did not show up in the meeting of April 14 has been added in this data that I got on April 18. This new route seems to effectively deal with the west service desert issue. This also means that the comments and feedback from the community are really being taken into consideration instead of being ignored. Therefore, I think the metro transit so far is doing a great job for this project."
